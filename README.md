## Note
I learned a lot from practicing with this project. However I could not build a fully functional product. I have decided that I will move on and come back for another go later on.

## Things I missed
- [X] Implement floating-point numbers
- [X] 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 yeilds 42
- [X] Backspace button added
- [X] Keyboard support
