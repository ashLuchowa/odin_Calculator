## Note
I learned a lot from practicing with this project. However I could not build a fully functional product. I have decided that I will move on and come back for another go later on.

## Things I missed
- [x] Implement floating-point numbers
- 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 does not yeild 42
- No backspace button
- No keyboard support
- Calculator logic is a mess (making me confused)
